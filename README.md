**Brief summary:**  
Species identification is essential to monitor and halt illegal timber trade (ITT). DNA-based identification (DNA barcoding) can be cheaper and more accurate than commonly used techniques (e.g. spectrometry, anatomy), but technical challenges have so far prevented its wide application to timber identification. Here, we will enable better ITT monitoring and regulation through DNA barcoding by providing research-based evidence of 1) the conditions for successful implementation of timber DNA barcoding, and 2) DNA barcoding methods applicable to key timber species.  
The project focuses on all species from genera *Entandrophragma*, *Khaya*, *Lovoa* and *Swietenia* and on the timber supply chains of Gabon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   
The project involved 1) stakeholder consultations and a workshop, 2) Using herbarium specimens hosted at Kew Herbarium to build a DNA reference dataset comprising up to 351 nuclear and 107 plastid genes for multiple individuals representing the distribution range of 22 species, 3) Using the reference dataset to dentify short individual DNA regions ("barcodes") that can be used on their own to assign samples to species, 4) Testing and refining protocols for DNA extraction from wood of the focus genera, and 5) testing if the PCR amplification and Sanger seqencing of the new barcodes (and of standard barcode ITS) was possible on wood samples of the focus genera (sapwood and heartwood) and if the data obtained were sufficient to assign samples to the correct species.  
  
**Outputs:**  
Report 1 describes the results from the stakeholder consultations and workshop, and synthesizes considerations regarding the implementation of DNA barcoding for the monitoring of the timber trade in the focus countries.  
Report 2 describes the DNA barcoding results.  
An article based on Report 2 has been submitted.
